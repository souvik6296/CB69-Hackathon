problem_title:<br> "Speech to text transcription for Indian languages. The problem entails transcription in the native script and then translation to English. The languages of interest are Hindi, Indian English, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi";<br><br>
Idea:<br> "We are going to build a website whose front-end will be made of basic HTML, CSS, JS and in back-end we are going to use PHP. We are also using Python to satisfy our actual motive of transcripting audio in thier actual script and to transalate in to english with indian ancent. We are doing whole the project on VS code and also using XAMPP for using localhost server. Integrating python with php and show off results is such a challenging task for us and also taking audio input and transcripting them into their actual script is not easy for us. We are going to use libraries like sys, googletrans, pyttsx3, gtts in python and speech recognition api in JS.";
